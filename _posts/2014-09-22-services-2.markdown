One of the app's features is to detect if a mole is a melanoma. You simply take a picture of the mole with the app and it will analyse it.

The analyse is done with a new technology which came of the IA field : convolution neural network.

The algorithm is really efficient with a mean accuracy precision above 90%.

This technology allows everybody to profit IA best algorithms in order to protect their skin.
